java-shareit
The service provides users, firstly, with the opportunity to tell what things they are willing to share, 
and secondly, to find the right thing and rent it for a while. The service should not only allow you to book an item 
for certain dates, but also deny access to it from others during the booking period. In case the required item 
is not available on the service, the user has the opportunity to leave requests. 
Data is stored in a database (Hibernate and JPA are used). 
The code is covered with tests (Mock, Unit and integration tests). Implemented microservice architecture using Docker.
